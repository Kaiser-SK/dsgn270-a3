# Assignment 3 - SVG Logo Design

# Sebastian Kaiser

# Description:

This is a logo for a company named Atom Technologies. I decided to start with making a basic 'atom' design, but after finishing it, I realised that just the atom was too generic. I then decided to make futuristic style lettering and use the previously made atom to replace the space normally in the letter 'A'.

# Journal Entry:

Comment 1: This was probably the most frustrating assignment that I've done. From creating a design from scratch, to styling each individual element in VS Code using CSS, it was very tedious and time consuming.
Comment 2: Once the SVG code was organized and had classes, it was quite easy to fill the individual elements.

Observation 1: Styling and coloring everything using figma seems a lot more practical and less time consuming. I can see the benefits of editing them using CSS, but it seems very, very tedious trying to find the correct elements to style.

Problem 1: A lot of the tools in figma didn't work as I thought they would, making it pretty hard to make a more complex design, so I mostly stuck to basic shapes and straight lines via the pen tool.
Problem 2: Styling the svg using css was VERY tedious and frustrating. I tried to seperate all of the paths & circles so that I could style them easier, but the trial and error of having to edit each individual one to see which one needed to be styled was very annoying.
Problem 3: No matter what element I chose to fill in the svg code, NONE of them allowed me to actually colour the entire background of the monochrome logo, despite me wanting to have a white-black gradient going across it.
